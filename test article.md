## Markdown Sample File

This is a sample file demonstrating various Markdown features.

### Headings

* This is a level 1 heading (h1)
* This is a level 2 heading (h2)
  * This is a level 3 heading (h3) within h2

### Text formatting

* **Bold** text can be achieved with asterisks (`**bold**`)
* _Italic_ text can be achieved with underscores (`_italic_`)
* You can also combine them: **_bold and italic_**
* Strikethrough text with two tildes (`~~strikethrough~~`)

### Quotes

> Block quotes are created with a single ">" symbol at the beginning of each line.
>> You can nest quotes for deeper emphasis.

### Lists

* Unordered lists use asterisks (`*`), pluses (`+`), or hyphens (`-`)
* This is an item
* This is another item
* Ordered lists use numbers followed by a period (".")
  1. This is the first item
  2. This is the second item
  3. This is the last item

### Code blocks

Inline code can be wrapped in backticks (` `) like this `print("Hello, world!")`

For multi-line code blocks, use fenced code blocks with three backticks followed by the language name (optional) on a separate line:

```python
def greet(name):
  """Prints a greeting message."""
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")```
