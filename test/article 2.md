## Sure, here are some other Markdown features you can explore:

* **Headers and Subheaders:** You can create different levels of headings (h1 to h6) using hash symbols (#) before the text. More hash symbols indicate a lower level heading.

* **Horizontal Rule:** Create a horizontal line to visually separate sections with three or more hyphens (`---`) on a separate line.

* **Code Blocks:** There are two ways to display code in Markdown:
    * Inline code: Wrap short snippets of code in backticks (` `).
    * Fenced code blocks: Use three backticks followed by the language name (optional) on a separate line. The code will be displayed with syntax highlighting depending on the platform.

* **Emphasis:** 
    * **Bold:** Use two asterisks (`**`) or underscores (`__`) around the text you want to emphasize.
    * **Italics:** Use one asterisk (`*`) or underscore (`_`) around the text.

* **Links:** Link text to a URL by placing the URL in parentheses following the text, enclosed in square brackets. 

* **Images:** Display images by using an exclamation mark (`!`), followed by the alternative text in square brackets, and then the image URL in parentheses.  

* **Tables:** Create tables using pipes (`|`) to separate columns and hyphens (`-`) to create dividers between rows and headers. 

* **Quotes:** Use a greater-than symbol (`>`) at the beginning of each line to create block quotes. You can nest quotes for deeper emphasis.

* **Lists:** Create unordered lists with asterisks (`*`), pluses (`+`), or hyphens (`-`) at the beginning of each line. Ordered lists use numbers followed by a period (".") at the beginning of each line.

* **Footnotes:** Add footnotes to your document by using a superscript number after the text and defining the footnote content at the bottom of the document, prefixed with the corresponding superscript number.

* **Comments:** While not directly visible in the rendered Markdown document, you can add comments for your own reference by using HTML comments (``).

These are just some of the many features available in Markdown. By exploring these features, you can create rich and informative documents with ease.
